# PageSpeed Insights

PageSpeed Insights is a tool that helps developers optimize their web pages by analyzing the pages and generating tailored suggestions to make the pages faster.

You could access PageSpeed Insights:

- From a [web UI](https://pagespeed.web.dev/). Run Lighthouse and link to reports without installing a thing.
- From the command line. Automate your Lighthouse runs via shell scripts.
- Over the [PageSpeed Insights API](https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/v5/get-started). Incorporate PageSpeed Insights analysis into your CI/CD pipeline or third-party tools.
