# Web Vitals Library

The web vitals library is a JavaScript library to measure core web vitals for all your users. The library is a small, production-ready wrapper around the underlying web APIs that measures the metrics. Please visit https://github.com/GoogleChrome/web-vitals to learn more about the library.

This folder contains two demos:

- One demo loads the web vitals library from a CDN and measures metrics with Google Analytics 4 through Google Tag Manager (demo-cdn)
- The other demo uses the npm package and measures metrics with Google Analytics 4 through Google Tag Manager (demo-npm-package)
