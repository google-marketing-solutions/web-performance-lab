# Measure CWV with npm package in Google Analytics 4 through Google Tag Manager

This demo shows how to measure the core web vitals metrics in Google Analytics 4 through Google Tag Manager. The core web vitals library is installed from npm.

## Prerequisites
Before getting started, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- NPM (Node Package Manager)
- Node.js

If you haven't installed them yet, please visit the official NPM and Node.js websites to download and install the latest versions for your operating system.

## Installation

To install the required dependencies, simply run the following command: `npm install`

This command will automatically fetch and install all the necessary dependencies listed in the project's package.json file. Make sure you run this command in the root directory of your project.

## Run the demo

To run the demo you need to perform a build run. Simply run the following command: `npm run build`

This command will compile the code with browserify and esmify - which are already included as dependencies - and store a bundle file in the files-folder.
