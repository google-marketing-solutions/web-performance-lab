# Lighthouse

Lighthouse is an open-source, automated tool for improving the quality of web pages. You can run it against any web page, public or requiring authentication. It has audits for performance, accessibility, progressive web apps, SEO, and more.

You could access Lighthouse:

- In Chrome DevTools. Easily audit pages that require authentication, and read your reports in a user-friendly format.
- From the command line. Automate your Lighthouse runs via shell scripts.
- As a Node module. Integrate Lighthouse into your continuous integration systems.
- From a web UI. Run Lighthouse and link to reports without installing a thing.
