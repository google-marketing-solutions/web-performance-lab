# Interaction to Next Paint (INP)

Interaction to Next Paint (INP) is a metric that measures the time it takes for a web page to
respond to user input and display the next visible change on the screen.
It focuses on the delay between user interaction, such as clicking a button or tapping a link, and
the resulting visual feedback on the page.
INP is an experimental metric used in the context of Chrome User Experience Report (CrUX) and
provides insights into the responsiveness and interactivity of a web page.

By analyzing INP, developers can optimize their websites to deliver smoother and more engaging user
experiences, ensuring that user interactions are promptly acknowledged and visually represented on
the screen.
